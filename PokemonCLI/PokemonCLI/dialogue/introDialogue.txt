Welcome to the world of Pokemon!
My name is Professor Dodger, and boy do I wish I could be there with you for the start of your Pokemon journey.
Unfortunately, I am being held up at my lab and will not be able to meet you in the field.
No worries, though. I will be there every step of the way to help you learn what it means to be a Pokemon master!
